[Short description of notebook]
Whisper is a versatile speech recognition model that can transcribe speech as well as perform multi-lingual translation and recognition tasks. It was trained on diverse datasets to give human-level speech recognition performance without the need for fine-tuning.

Graphcore's IPU (Intelligence Processing Unit) is a completely new kind of massively parallel processor to accelerate machine intelligence. Developers can access advanced, cost-efficient IPU compute on-demand in the cloud for building, fine-tuning and deploying AI models such as Whisper.

[Description of notebook, for example]
In this Paperspace Gradient notebook, we demonstrate using Whisper Tiny for speech recognition and transcription on the IPU. We use Optimum Graphcore - a new open-source library and toolkit that enables developers to access IPU-optimized models certified by Hugging Face. Only a few lines of code are needed to get this state-of-the-art automated speech recognition model running on IPUs.
