    "[GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) is a causal decoder-only transformer model which can be used for text-generation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Language models are very powerful because a huge variety of tasks can be formulated as text-to-text problems and thus adapted to fit the generative setup, where the model is asked to correctly predict future tokens. This idea has been widely explored in the [T5 paper: Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified\n",

    "You can easily adapt this example to do your custom fine-tuning on several downstream tasks, such as Question Answering, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification in general: you just need to prepare data in the right way.\n",

    "Note that, for these kind of tasks you don't need GPT-3 175B sized models. GPT-J at 6B has very good language understanding and is suitable for most of these scenarios.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This notebook has demonstrated how easy it is to perform Fine-Tuning on GPT-J on the Graphcore IPU for a text entailment task. While not as powerful as larger models for free text-generation, medium-size auto-regressive models GPT-J can still be successfully fine-tuned to handle a range of NLP downstream tasks such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. In fact, for these kind of tasks you don't need GPT-3 175B sized models. GPT-J at 6B has very good language understanding and is ideally suited & highly efficient for most of these scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we performed fine-tuning on GPT-J as a Causal Language Model (CLM) for Text Entailment on GLUE MNLI dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily adapt this example to do your custom fine-tuning on several downstream tasks, such as question answering, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, & text classification in general – by preparing your data accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this notebook showcases the potential for GPT-J to be used effectively and efficiently for Fine-Tuning. Next, find out how GPT-J can be used effectively and efficiently on several downstream tasks after a simple fine-tuning with our Text generation on IPU using GPT-J – Inference notebook, GPTJ-generative-inference.ipynb."
